npm -> doesn't stand for Node package manager
 
https://github.com/npm/npm-expansions/blob/HEAD/expansions.txt

its a package manager

npm basically a standard repository for all project 

Manages data for you and project

npm init 




PS G:\learn-react> npm init
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.

Package.json is generating after run above comments basically a configuration of an npm
its created a json file 
Why we need package.json?
    Node is Package manager 
    Project dependent on more packages 
    Npm take care of version it where it taken package.json
    configuration of Npm

Installing dependency packages 
    Installing most important package in our project is bundler 
    what is bundler?
        Html and js whole code cleaned , whole code 
        webpack, parcel or wheat are the bundler
        Bundle the app so that 

    Currently we going to use parcel bundler
    parcel will 
    commands:    
    2 types of dependency we can install
        - one is dev dependency    -> Development face while developing a app that time require dev dependency
        - one is normal dependency -> production

    -D dev dependency
    npm install -D parcel
    

     "parcel": "^2.16.3" -->

      ^ is basically known as caret 
      ^ 2.16.3 while but this symbol new minor version upgrade came means its automatically upgrade the version
      ~ 3.01.1 -> major upgrade cames it automatically upgrade 

      ^ is best use it while because advance major updates creates depcrecated issues                                  

what is package.json
  - configuration of npm
  - its keep track of what version installed in our system
  - installed minor version install
What is package-lock.json
  - kind of lock the version and exact version of package installed
  - extact version will be mentioend
  - its keep the track of all the version and dependency
  
what is integrity?
hash -> 

node_modules

i installed only parcel
other modules why installed 
parcel is project have own dependency


Every modules having its own package.json
node module is kind of database.
 

Package and package.lock json note what are all dependency of version so update all the git

Suppose node_modules its will create basically install based on the package and package.lock version

Ingite our app: npx parcel index.html

npm -> installing the packages
npx -> executing the package

Install react : npm install react
install react-dom : npm install react-dom 
small version  : npm i react-dom

After installed this will be shown

App.js:10 Uncaught ReferenceError: React is not defined

import React  from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

By using import , importing the react and react-dom modules from node modules


Parcel :
   - it create a dev build
   - it create a local server 
   - it is doing HMR => Hot Module Replacement
   - File watching algorithm - writtern in c++;
   - caching - faster builds -> caching every things to do faster
   - image optimization 
   - minification files 
   - bundle all the files 
   - compress the files so many work parcel can do......  
   - eg:  PM modi - react 
      Amit sha -> parcel and small minister
      like finance minister ->
   - consistent hashing -> keeps track -> 
   - code splitting 
   - differential bunding -> app can be opened in internet explorer older version 
                             open in chrome or firefox
                             to support older browser
   - diagnostic
   - error handling
   - Https - parcel gives this feature
   - https://parceljs.org/ --> how to read
   - Tree shaking -> algorithm -> will remove unused code for you 
   - Different components for dev
   - Different components for production
   
  - Remove the app.js in package.json file


When execute parsel?
   its generate the dev build 


Production build generate : npx react build index.html
Dev build generate : npx react index.html


Run old module have to check browser list

 "broserslist":[
    "last 2 chrome version",
    "last 2 firefox version"
  ]   when declare only work on those browsers
